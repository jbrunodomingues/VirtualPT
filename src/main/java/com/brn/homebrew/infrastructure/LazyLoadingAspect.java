/**
 * Created by bruno on 12/12/13.
 *
 * This class serves for getting rid of lazy initialization exception when jackson was serializing. Basically because
 * jackson inner serialization methods where called after the end of transaction when the virtual proxy tried to
 * access the database there was no longer any open session to play with. With this aspect joint point at the end of
 * return of my controller method (application layer) I force the lazy load by using a library called dozer. This way
 * I can have the lazy loading working properly at service layer level but when the controller returns the bean it
 * loads all the lazy loaded elements.
